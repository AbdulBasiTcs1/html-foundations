# In html we have different tags to define different elements of a webpage.
# Here we have used the following tags:
# 1. <!DOCTYPE html> - Defines the document type and version of HTML.
# 2. <html> - The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
# 3. <head> - Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title.
# 4. <title> - Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
# 5. <body> - Contains the content of the webpage that is visible to users
# 6. <h1> - Defines a top-level heading.
# 7. <p> - Defines a paragraph of text.
# Each tag has an opening tag (e.g., <h1>) and a closing tag (e.g., </h1>).
# Tags are usually written in pairs, with content placed between the opening and closing tags.
# Tags can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
# This is a simple HTML document structure demonstrating basic tags.
# The content inside the <body> tag is what will be displayed on the webpage.
