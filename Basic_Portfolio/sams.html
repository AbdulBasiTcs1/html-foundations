    <h2>Scheduling Algorithms System (C++ – Operating Systems Concepts)
</h2>
    <p>This project is based on Operating Systems scheduling algorithms and is implemented in C++. It simulates different CPU scheduling techniques such as FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. The goal of this system is to analyze process execution, waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization. This project strengthened my understanding of OS-level process management and low-level system behavior.</p>
