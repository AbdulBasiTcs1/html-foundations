    <h2>Bank Management System (Java – OOP Based)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My Bank Management System is a Java-based application developed using core <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> principles such as <u>encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. </u>This system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and manage customer details efficiently. The main purpose of this project was to strengthen my understanding of real-world problem solving using OOP concepts while maintaining a structured and modular codebase.</p>
