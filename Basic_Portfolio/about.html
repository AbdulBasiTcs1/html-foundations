    <pre>
        I am a passionate Computer Science student at COMSATS University Islamabad (Attock Campus) with a strong academic record (CGPA: 3.97)
        and a deep interest in software development. I specialize in building logical, efficient, and user-friendly solutions while continuously 
        learning modern technologies.
        I have hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Database Systems (SQL), and app development concepts, and I am actively 
        working towards becoming a professional developer. I believe in halal earning, ethical work, and constant self-improvement.
        My goal is to grow into a top-tier developer, contribute to impactful projects, and build solutions that solve real-world problems.</pre>
