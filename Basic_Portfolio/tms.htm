    <h2>Task Management System (DSA Based)
</h2><br>
<p>The Task Management System is designed using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts to efficiently organize, track, and prioritize tasks. This system uses optimized data structures to manage task insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting operations. The project helped me understand how different data structures impact performance and how algorithmic thinking is essential for building scalable and efficient systems.</p>
